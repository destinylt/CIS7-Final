This program aims to provide accurate encryption and decryption of a message input from the user implementing Vigenere Cipher.

Start by inputting a message and pressing enter. Then input a keyword and press enter. Output will include your message, your keyword, the keyword repeated until it matches the length of the message, the encrypted message, and the decrypted message.

Thank you!
